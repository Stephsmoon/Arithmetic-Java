# Challenge 001 : Arithmeticjava

The given challenge was to "Determine the postfix of an arithmetic expression; then solve the expression using stacks and the postfix in Java". 

Arithmeticjava is a program which takes in the an airthmetic expression input from either a scanner object or a declared variable variable and creates an object from that input. Along with the Constructors, Modifiers, and Accessors, the object will automatically determine the postfix of the expression object and can return the result from the postfix. 

## Compiling and Running

This was all compiled, built, and ran through the terminal using the compile.sh script. 

```bash
sh ./compile.sh
```

Although the program can be runned through the terminal through the following command.

```bash
java runner.java
```

## Resources

Resources that where used included my Notes from my Automata Class and the Wikipedia Page for Postfix. This Project was originally done during the Semester I took the Automata Class, and later updated for Github.
